# ML_song_clustering
This is the 7th project of the wbs coding school bootcamp in data science.

### The project
The topic is unsupervised ML. The use case is clustering a dataset of 5000 songs to create playlists by their audio features from Spotify. The audio features included acousticness, danceability, duration_ms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, time_signature, and valence. The data was cleaned, explored and analyzed. Clustering was explored using hierarchical clustering. The playlists were created with KMeans, k was chosen via the elbow method and the silhouette score.
In the end, the project was presented in a [presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFr-LwU_fo/a5MrLObZxHtS8LydSiKioQ/edit?utm_content=DAFr-LwU_fo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).
